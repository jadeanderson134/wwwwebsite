Writing functions in Python is an incredibly useful skill, it allows you to bundle a set of instructions so that you can repeatedly use them in a variety of contexts. This means you don't have to rewrite complicated code over and over, or saves you time if you will know you will have to use a specific function repeatedly. The below code counts characters in a string!

```{python}
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

counts = {}
for c in sentence:
  if c in counts:
    counts[c]+=1
  else:
    counts[c]=1
    
for c in counts:
  print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
```

To create a function just add "def" in front of your new_function_name(function_imput), this defines the function you wrote! Then you will be able to apply this function to an unlimited amount of strings!

```{python}
def character_count(sentence):
  counts = {}
  for c in sentence:
    if c in counts:
      counts[c]+=1
    else:
      counts[c]=1
      
  for c in counts:
    print(c, "appears", counts[c], "times")
    
    
newsentence = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump."
character_count(newsentence)
```

As you can see, the ability to write python functions is very versatile and easy to use!

Have fun coding! :)
