## Jade Anderson's Resume


  Hi! I'm a third year Biology and Sustainability Studies student at the University of Texas at Austin.

  I love spending time outside, making art, perusing vintage stores, and learning about science! 

  I spent this past semester (Fall 2019) learning RStudio and familiarizing myself with Python! If you navigate to the Projects tab of this website you can see some of the work I am most proud of!

  From July 2019 to December 2019, I interned at the environmental non-profit Devils River Conservancy as a Database Developer!

  Some of my duties as a database developer included:

    Executing a project focused on sweeping, reviewing, and 
    compiling over 600 journal articles, legislative bills,
    historic archives and other documents regarding the
    Devils River into a Zotero database
    
    Assisting the Executive Director in grant research 
    and proposal
    
    Attending a research based trip to Del Rio, Texas in
