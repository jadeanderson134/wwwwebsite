      <description>Writing functions in Python is an incredibly useful skill, it allows you to bundle a set of instructions so that you can repeatedly use them in a variety of contexts. This means you don’t have to rewrite complicated code over and over, or saves you time if you will know you will have to use a specific function repeatedly. The below code counts characters in a string!

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 10/20/2019. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later!
I envision your written text forming something of a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>

      <description>Jade Anderson’s Resume Hi! I’m a third year Biology and Sustainability Studies student at the University of Texas at Austin.
I love spending time outside, making art, perusing vintage stores, and learning about science!
I spent this past semester (Fall 2019) learning RStudio and familiarizing myself with Python! If you navigate to the Projects tab of this website you can see some of the work I am most proud of!</description>
